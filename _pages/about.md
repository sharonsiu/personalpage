Hi dear!

**Welcome to my site.** I'm Sharon.

My story
======

Secondary school
------
It all begins with a girl named Sharon, who took DT classes at school. It took her a few classes to make her realize that she enjoyed the process so much. She made her own keychain that was originally a piece of wood, and she even performed her first soldering on an electric board.
Soon, she got into robotics after she found out there was a robotics club. She went there a few times per week, and she loved it, but she didn't know what she was doing at all. She just stayed there and watched those boys and girls build and fix the robots using screwdrivers. Once, they went to a competition at Hong Kong Science Park. It was an eye-opening experience for her because that was her first time to get in such a big event. She couldn't show all the excitement on her face. She watched from one round to another round of the game. Deeply inside, she admired those whose put behind-the-scenes effort

University
------
University is the place where Sharon turned herself into a big girl. There is a saying: there's always a rainbow after the storm. She had suffered from depression for more than two-thirds of her time. Additionally, her academics didn't go so well in the first two years, which made her days go even harder. Things got a bit better in her junior year when she started to pick up her studies. She started to learn and appreciate things that had been taught in class. Even though she graduated, she was motivated to pursue more knowledge in her field, and she chose to take a master program right after her degree. At that time, she had taken care of her mental issues within a year or so and gradually overcame the 'beast' inside.

Master and Now
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

Hi dear! **Welcome to my site.** I'm Sharon.


My story
======

Secondary school
------
It all begins with a girl named Sharon, who took DT classes at school. It took her a few classes to make her realize that she enjoyed the process so much. She made her own keychain that was originally a piece of wood, and she even performed her first soldering on an electric board.

Soon, she got into robotics after she found out there was a robotics club. She went there a few times per week, and she loved it, but she didn't know what she was doing at all. She just stayed there and watched those boys and girls build and fix the robots using screwdrivers. Once, they went to a competition at Hong Kong Science Park. It was an eye-opening experience for her because that was her first time to get in such a big event. She couldn't show all the excitement on her face. She watched from one round to another round of the game. Deep inside, she admired those who were willing to put in tonnes of effort and dream big, just like the members of her team. Although they were not praised for their championship, they were praised for their companionship at the end. From that day on, her vision became crystal clear, and she knew she would become an engineer one day.

University
------
University is the place where Sharon turned herself into a big girl. There is a saying: there's always a rainbow after the storm. She had suffered from depression for more than two-thirds of her four-year time at university. Additionally, her academics didn't go so well in the first two years, which made her days go even harder. Things got a bit better in her junior year when she started to pick up her studies. She started to learn and appreciate things that had been taught in class. Even though she graduated, she was motivated to pursue more knowledge in her field, and she chose to take a master's program right after her degree. At that time, she had taken care of her mental issues for a year or so and gradually overcame the 'beast' inside.

Now
------
Fast forward, she is almost at the end of her study journey, which leaves her last few credits in her program. She has been taking electronics-related courses and developing projects for the past few years. She knew that her engineering journey wasn't just that, and there was so much more waiting for her. Books are just knowledge. To make the knowledge become practical, real-life projects have to come along. She is now looking for an opportunity to take a professional path.

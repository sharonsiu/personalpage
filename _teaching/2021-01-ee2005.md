EE2005 is under the PALSI (Peer Assisted Learning using Supplemental Instruction) scheme. PALSI aims to provide additional support from those who had scored an A in that particular course to the students currently studying it. 

EE2005 is a course that introduces fundamental electronic components, such as capacitors and inductors. This will allow students to grasp the knowledge if they enter the electronics field in the future. The teaching set-up is mainly online on Zoom where I explained some concepts to them in a friendly mood.

Students are asked to implement the logical circuit design on an entry-level FPGA board. By coding VHDL in Vivado Design Suite software, we expect them to get a hands-on experiment by applying the knowledge that have learned in lectures. I was responsible for teaching students lab materials and solving the error messages raised by their software.
